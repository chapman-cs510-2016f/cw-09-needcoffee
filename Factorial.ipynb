    "### Describing the algorithm  \n",
    "The factorial function takes a single integer argument, `n`, and also initializes an integer `fac` to the value of `n`. While `n` is positive, it is decremented, and `fac` is assigned the values of `fac*n`. Once `n` is decremented to 0, or if it is initialized with a value less than 1, `fac` is returned. "

    "### Problems with the current function definition  \n",
    "There are two main problems with the function definition as it stands. The first is that the case of `n=0`, which should return 1 since $0!=1$, returns 0 instead. The second issue i s that, for any integer input grater than 0, the function continues to return 0. This is due to how `n` is decremented in the `while` loop. When `n=1` and enters the loop, it is decremented to 0, which is then multiplied by `fac`. Then we exit the loop and return `fac`, which will always be 0 because of that final product."

    "### Fixing the function  \n",
    "The first problem can be fixed rather easily: an `if` statement for `n=0` would suffice. Then, changing the condition in the `while` loop to be `n>1` would solve the issue of the final loop multiplying by 0. Though it is not affecting the validity of the functions output, changing the type of `n` to `unsigned int` could be beneficial; the input for a function that computes the factorial, in most cases, should not be negative. However, since an `unsigned int` can store larger values than an `int`, if the result of the function is to be used in calculations with `int`s, there could be problems when the result is typecasted. Instead, we will add an `if` statement that returns -1 when `n` is negative."
